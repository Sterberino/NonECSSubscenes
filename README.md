# NonECSSubscenes
A system for Subscenes in Unity that mimics Unity's ECS SubScenes, without using the Entity Component System. Not compatible with the Entities package. I made this because I wanted the organizational benefits Unity's SubScene system brought without having to convert my current project to ECS.

## How To use
Make sure that the SubSceneEditor script is located in your Editor folder. More information can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html). You can create a new Subscene using the following static methods:

- SubScene.CreateEmptySubscene()
- SubScene.CreateSubsceneFromGameobject()
- SubScene.CreateSubsceneFromGameobjects()

You can also right click on GameObjects in the Hierarchy of an existing Scene, and select the Menu Option: **New Subscene From Selection**.

### Opening and Closing SubScenes
Opening and closing the SubScenes is simple.

```
  SubScene subScene;
  subScene.OpenSubscene();
  subScene.CloseSubscene(saveFlag);
```

Please remember that scene loading is Asynchronous, and read the comments on these methods for more information.

## Known Issues
1. There's currently a reflection issue causing an error to be logged to the Unity Console. It doesn't seem to cause any other issues.
2. Sometimes, saving a Scene with an active SubScene prompts a Unity Editor Error Message claiming that the Scene was unable to be saved. Clicking "Try Again" or "Cancel" successfully saves the Scene.
